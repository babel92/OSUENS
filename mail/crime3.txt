Public Safety Notice



On 5/22/17, shortly after 2 a.m., The Ohio State University Department of Public Safety received information from the Columbus Division of Police about a threat of violence for Ohio State’s campus. Law enforcement has determined it not to be a credible threat.



The suspects made a number of unsubstantiated threats including a statement that they would “shoot up campus” and indicated bombs were placed in duffel bags with one located at the main entrance of a library. University Police immediately responded and located an unidentified bag in the area of Ohio State’s 18th Avenue Library.



Out of an abundance of caution, the library was evacuated while law enforcement investigated the unidentified bag. The bag was cleared and information about the police activity was shared with the community via social media. All other campus libraries were closed overnight. However, police searched those areas as a precaution. Nothing was found, it was determined not to be a credible threat.



University Police will remain visible throughout campus. The safety of students, faculty, staff and visitors is our number one priority. As always, we encourage the community to report any suspicious behavior to OSU Police by calling 614-292-2121, or by dialing 9-1-1 in emergencies.
